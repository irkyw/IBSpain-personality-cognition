# IBSpain-personality-cognition
The relationships between IBS pain, personality and cognition
The current study explored associations between chronic pain, personality, and cognitive function in a sample of IBS
patients participating in an ongoing project at Haukeland University Hospital, Bergen, Norway. 
The rationale of this inquiry is that we need to understand more about personality profiles and emotional and cognitive function of the
patients with IBS to improve treatment options, with a primary concern for its main symptom: visceral pain. 
This information is expected to contribute to improved understanding of how we can make treatment more effective for this patient group.
